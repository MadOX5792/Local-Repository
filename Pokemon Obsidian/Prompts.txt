Prompts:

Hello! I'd like the following images generated in the Generation 3, Fire Red, Leaf Green style. The final images for the trainer sprites should be 128 pixels by 128 pixels. The sprite sheet should match the Generation 3 sprite sheet requirements of Pokemon Essentials (128 pixels by 192 pixels). I've attached examples. Please try and stay consistent with the palettes used in the original Emerald, Sapphire, Ruby, Fire Red, Leaf Green. This is not a hard and fast. If you think something will come out better with colors outside of those palettes, do it and don't worry about it.

1st Trainer:
Name: Mint
Role: Player Character.
Sex: Female
Appearance: Dark black or brown hair. Tom boy, but still fashionable. Hair is styled short.
Color Palette Musts: Color palette should include the color Mint. Your choice on cooler or lighter shades.
Personality: Cool. Confident. Reserved. Intelligent.
Other notes: She should match the style of other Generation 3 player character sprites, while looking unique. 

2nd trainer:
Name: Brandt
Role: Fire Type Gym Leader
Sex: Male
Appearance: White. Large, bushy beard. Red haired. Tawny, worn complexion. Middle aged with signs of a tough life. Tends a lighthouse. Should be wearing fishing waders. Fishing waders have suspenders rising up over shoulders. He's barrel-chested. Not quite as muscular as Bruno. But still pretty swole. He should be wearing a form-fitting shirt. Not quite a wife-beater, but similar. 
Color Palette Musts: Color palette is up to you. But should invoke nautical themes. 
Personality: Stern. No-nonsense. 
Other notes: None.

3rd Trainer:
Name: Professor Cedar
Role: Pokemon Professor of Pokeanthropology.
Sex: Female
Appearance: Think Mirabelle from Encanto, but older and slightly plumper. She's ethnically Latina.
Color Palette Musts: I've attached a sample image of Professor Cedar. I like the color palette they used on her.
Personality: Energetic. Enthusiastic. Uninhibited.
Other notes: None.

4th trainer:
Name: Jack
Role: Dark Type gym leader.
Sex: Male
Appearance: White. Late 20s, early 30s something. Lean. Maybe Victorian inspired. He's from a wealthy family. But doesn't have his full inheritance. He's not evil. But he is pragmatic and ambitious. Perhaps he wears a dark peacoat and a newsboy cap?
Color Palette: Cool. Dark. Mysterious.
Other notes: none.
